/**
 * Calculates the next number for the specified Sudoku puzzle.
 * The function returns whether the puzzle *isSolvable*, and it returns the *row*, the *column*, and the *entry* itself for the next number.
 *
 * In particular, the function returns the entry for the field with the fewest number of possible entries.
 * For instance, if there is a field with 7 possible entries and another field with only 2 possible entries, a correct entry for the latter is returned.
 *
 * **NOTE:** If the Sudoku puzzle is already completely solved, this function returns value -1 for *row*, *column*, and *entry*.
 * @param sudoku the Sudoku puzzle for which the next entry should be calculated
 * @returns the entry for the next field
